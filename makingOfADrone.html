                <h3>What is A Drone and Drone Technology?</h3>
                <p>Drones or UAVs are designed with the ability to fly in the air without a pilot. Most of the latest drones that are on the market are equipped with <strong>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS and GLONASS.</strong> There are 2 ways on how drones can fly; <strong>in GNSS mode or in non-satellite mode.</strong> Most DJI drones can fly in P-Mode (that includes GPS & GLONASS) or in ATTI mode, which does not use satellite navigation. The drone must use GPS in order to return home (it’s starting position). High-precision navigation is very important when flying, especially if the drone is used for 3D mapping, terrain surveying and Search & Rescue missions. <strong>GNSS signal is determined by 3 factors: the inclination angle of the satellite, the altitude of the orbit, and the Earth ground-level ‘field of view’.</strong> Drones with obstacle detection and collision avoidance sensors are increasingly popular in the consumer and professional sectors. This obstacle detection and avoidance technology started with sensors that are able to detect objects in front of the drone. Such systems scan the environment, and then the software algorithms with SLAM technology make it into 3D maps, allowing them to detect and avoid objects. Unmanned aerial vehicle technology covers everything from the aerodynamics of the drone, materials in the manufacture of the physical UAV, to the circuit boards, chipset and software, which are the brains of the drone. This Phantom UAVs are ideal to explain drone technology because they have everything in one package.  It includes the UAV, gimbal and camera. They also have some of the top drone technology on the market today. In the past few months, more new and highly advanced drones such as the <strong>DJI Mavic Mini, Mavic 2, Mavic Air 2, Phantom 4 Pro V2.0, Yuneec Typhoon H3 and Autel Evo 2</strong> have come to the market. The fast pace of UAV drone technological innovation is tremendous.

                <h3>How do Drones Work?</h3>
                <p>The drone is a “remotely piloted aircraft” (RPA) that have no pilot on board. They are also classified as remotely piloted systems (RPAS). Some types of drones are controlled with an app on the tablet, smartphone, or computer, while others are controlled by a remote controller. <strong>Drones work by using their rotors, which have propellers that are attached to a motor, which allow the drone to hover.</strong> When these rotors spin together, they are pushing the air down and the air pushes back up on the rotors. That way, the drone lifts up into the sky and flies. A typical unmanned aircraft is made of light composite materials to reduce weight and increase maneuverability. This composite material strength allows military drones to cruise at extremely high altitudes. UAV drones are equipped with different state of the art technology such as infrared cameras, GPS and laser (consumer, commercial and military UAV). Drones are controlled by remote ground control systems (GSC) and also referred to as a ground cockpit. An unmanned aerial vehicle system has two parts, the drone itself and the control system. The nose of the unmanned aerial vehicle is where all the sensors and navigational systems are present. The rest of the body is full of drone technology systems since there is no space required to accommodate humans. The engineering materials used to build the drone are highly complex composites designed to absorb vibration, which decrease the sound produced. These materials are very light weight. The drones can work mainly in two ways; <strong>Piloted by the pilot using the remote controller that allows the drone to be guided in real-time or Not Piloted, in this case, they perform their task independently (after programming the “on-board computer” or with remote control via software).</strong> Before losing the signal (on remote controller), professional drones can reach up to 3 km (1.8 mi) distance, while low-budget drones have a much lower range. Similar considerations can also be made for autonomy: generally, low-budget drones can fly for a few minutes (10-15 for medium-low range drones), but the flight duration of a professional drone can even reach 40 minutes.</p>
